# pixelflut-infrastructure
:warning: There is a [fork](https://github.com/Poeschl/pixelflut-infrastructure) by [Markus PÃ¶schl](https://github.com/Poeschl) with recent updates. Go check it out!

A docker-setup with pixelflut server (shoreline), VNC-relay and monitoring of the game.

With this tool you can start an pixelflut server, acting as VCN-Server.
The game and server are monitored with prometheus and grafana.
A VNC-Relay/Multiplexer is provided to take the load of all the people watching the game from the pixelflut server.

For real usage - e.g. at large hacker events - i definitive suggest using two servers:
Server 1 to run only the pixelflut server.
Server 2 to run the VNC-Relay and Montitoring-Setup (this tool).
People watching connect with their VNC-Viewer to the second server.
When starting this tool you can choose to start your own pixelflut server, or monitor an other server.
Important: This tool is made for the pixelflut server https://github.com/TobleMiner/shoreline, other servers likely wont work (dont have VNC and expose statistics).

## Preperation
You must have docker and docker-compose installed. See https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.
After that run
```
./run.sh
```
and follow the instruction on the screen.
